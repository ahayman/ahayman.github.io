My first "sketch", although calling it a sketch may not be accurate. I created worked on it off and on for over two years, intending to give it as a gift to my wife. Eventually, I used [Fracture](https://fractureme.com) to print it on a big piece of glass and gave it to my wife for Christmas or maybe her birthday; I don't actually recall. It broke on our move to PA, so I'll need to replace it.

I made a lot of mistakes just learning Procreate. Mostly, how to effectively use layers.  Layers are really, really important. They allow you to try something new without ruining all your work, but you've gotta remember to 1) use them and 2) make sure you're actually drawing on the correct one.

Like I said, I made a lot of mistakes, but I also learned a lot.

The final product is decent. The shadows could use some work, but I think the colors are nice. I redrew the bud in the top-left at least a dozen times and even now I'm not happy with it. The stem especially could use more work, especially more texture and shadow. I have no intention of doing any of that, of course; this is as far as I'll take this sketch.

As a first try, though, I'm not disappointed. It's good for what it is.

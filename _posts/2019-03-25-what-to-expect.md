Welcome to my new blog!  Mostly, this is a place for me to share my short stories and post any news related to me and writing.  I may also end up turning this into my central hub for other writing projects, but that’s for the future.

I’m posting short stories, generally under 10k words, although I’ll rarely post anything so long as that.  Most of the time, I’m finding my short stories are between 1k and 3k words, although occasionally I’ll post stuff that’s barely a story at all.  

It’s all going to be fiction and probably mostly fiction.  I make no guarantees, though.  If I get an idea and write a short story from it, even if it’s only a few hundred words, I’ll post it. 

Warning: Some of my stuff may be dark or disturbing.  I’m not one to shy away from violence or disturbing scenes.  I’m also not one to relish in them either.  They exist for the story and nothing more.

I’m going to try to post most everything, as long as its finished.  It may be good, or it may not be.  I rather hope that as I continue to grow as a writer, more and more of the stuff I post will be good.  

And that’s it for now.  I hope anyone who finds this enjoys my short stories. :-)

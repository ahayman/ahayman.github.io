![Sketch of Brother](https://photos.aaronhayman.com/uploads/medium/3239beb6b5587dff527a85347e714989@2x.png)

_My brother, Mike._

<!--start-->

I sketched this from a photo I took on a recent vacation our two families did together for the first time... ever? We'd certainly seen each other before, but this time we rented a cabin in the mountains and let our all five of our kids go wild.

Mike has a hard time not throwing on a goofy face whenever a camera is aimed at him. It's fantastic. I really want to sketch interesting faces, especially expressions, and so I naturally gravitated toward his photos [^1].

Again, this was done on Procreate. For this drawing, I entirely used their charcoal 'brushes', which I really like. That being said, this sketch looks unfinished compared to what I'm doing now. 

<!--more-->

- While I had done some touch up work with the blending tool, I didn't do much (mostly just for skin tone). 
- Shadows are almost non-existent, used only for defining the features rather than, you know, actual shadows. But shadows are also really hard. I've noticed I tend to draw too light, especially with the shadows. I once read that when sketching, "your lightest shadows are darker than your darkest light." It's hard to draw shadows the way they should without feeling like you're doing too much.
- His goatee is meh, as is his hair. At this point, I had not yet realized Procreate actually has a few brushed explicitly for hair. 
- His clothes/jacket is basically an afterthought.
- Proportions are okay, but his right eye (your right) is a little off. 
- The lips are... wrong. I don't think it's noticeable at first glance, but at a closer look... yeah, they're uneven.
- The nose is generally correct, but the shadows (again) aren't quite right.

Despite all those... deficiencies, I still think it's a decent sketch. I've captured his expression fairly well, and most of the proportions are decent. 

I believe I spent maybe four or five hours on it.

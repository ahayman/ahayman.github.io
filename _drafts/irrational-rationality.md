Why do some people believe clearly false ideas?

It's a question I've been turning over in my mind for... ah, no reason, really, just random thoughts, definitely not anything political. And since these random-but-clearly-not-political musings are bouncing around my head, I figured I could examine a couple non-politically charged ideas.

 - Qanon?  Nope, staying far away from that.
 - Holocaust deniers? Hmm... no, if only because it turns my stomach.
 - Chem trails? Meh... so last decade.
 - Illuminati? So last century?
 - Bill Gates seeding the world with metal snow? A little to far into the crazy.
 - Flat Earthers? Ah, so I kind of feel like that one's cheating.

Actually, let's go with that: flat earthers. There are a not insignificant number of people that believe the earth is flat, truly. On the face of it, this is a remarkably obvious and to many, a stupid belief. There's an astonishing amount of 'proof'.

Yet I guarantee they've seen it all.

Give them this proof, I dare you; see what happens. Because for every piece of proof you give them, they will have a well-thought out rebuttal that "proves" the proof is either wrong or has been faked.

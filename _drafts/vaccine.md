The birth of the internet was hailed as a boon, perhaps _the_ boon, for the democracy of information. With starry eyes, it was hailed as the great leveler of knowledge. No more would knowledge be locked up behind ivory doors, only to be read by the robed elite [^1]. Instead, the poor masses could be enlightened as the flood gates of wisdom opened up.

And oh boy, did they open.

The internet did, in fact, give everyone access to just about any kind of information a person might want, up to and including the kind one used to (and still often does) pay large sums of money for [^2]. In theory, this should have led to naturalized erudition. Turns out, the people took one look at enlightenment and gave a collective 'meh', before flipping to the next cat video.

If that were the end of the story, I think humanity could easily live with the results. Perhaps the people haven't become enlightened like they should; perhaps enlightenment was always a fantasy dreamt up by those out of touch with reality anyway. But at least the _option_ is there. Those who wish to pursue knowledge can do so, and now they can do it from their phone.

But the internet didn't just tear down ivory walls, it removed the friction for all information everywhere, period, full stop.

At first, this was fine. Sure, there were stupid people out there, and these people wrote vile blogs or what not, but the scope of their damage was limited to a single URL address one had to know in advance. The spread of filth, while available, was naturally contained by obscurity. We could find them, of course, and skim the rot with a vague unease coupled with disgust-invoked condemnation; but then we could laugh comfortably in the knowledge of the site's likely ten per month visitor metrics.

Over time, there were attempts to collate the many blogs floating around, perhaps index them, give the people a voice, or at least the distant chance of being heard. Some of these even continue to this day [^3], but I'd argue their continued existence is largely due to the next internet phenomena, Social Media [^4].

While Social Media had a few false starts, the current incumbents are known by... well, everyone. Their success came largely due to their understanding of one important fact [^5]: people don't just want to speak, they want to be heard.

The problem with blog hosts was that while they sought to expose their resident blogs to the world, they were, in fact, horrible at it. Even should one regularly visit their page, or index, or feed, whatever, the most one would see is a few blog posts out of... what, thousand? Millions? The vast majority of bloggers were consigned to an obscurity arguably worse than if they'd simply hosted their own content, contending, as they were, with everyone else's posts, posts likely far more interesting, even as they read yours. At least on your own blog, your visitors aren't distracted by ads for other people's posts.

Social Media made a game out of having followers, or "friends" if you're willing to stretch the term a whole freakin' lot. Your friend count or follow count or your 'reach', has become a badge of achievement, a veritable proof of popularity; it became a thing to achieve and thus something to work for. Perhaps the most important aspect of this is reciprocity: "be my friend" is something the other _wants_ to do, if only to increase their own badge of popular honor. "Go read my blog" simply doesn't have the same appeal.

Beyond the self aggrandizement of pumping your own stats, this gamified system provided a baked-in audience. Now, when you write down your soul-inspired thoughts [^6], you had an instant audience that would at least see the content. Better yet, the more _engaging_ you could be, the more people might 'like' what you have to say.

And so that last bit of friction, obscurity, was removed wholesale.

I recently heard a dismissive and very reductive explanation for all the hate being thrown around these days. Despite its simplicity, I found it quite cuts close to the point of the matter: 

> The evil people are talking to each other. 

While true, this is obviously reductionist, and I have serious doubts the problems of the internet could ever be so easily reduced. Yet it does highlight something that's probably closer to the core issue: How did they find each other?

I posit evil people don't sit at their computers randomly typing evil looking URL addresses, all in the hopes of finding like-minded evil people to spread their villainy. "Mwa ha ha" is appealing in the movies, but perhaps an unrealistic depiction of reality.

No, they found each other because they were _shown_ each other.

"Hey, have you met..." is the ongoing chant of social media [^7], and they're not just showing you random people; they're showing you like-minded people, or trying to at least [^8]. They are essentially solving the problem of discoverability for you, and on the surface this is kind of awesome. 

Finding and having friends is a core part of the human experience. It drills down into the quintessential social self; we are not human without it. And so by facilitating this essential human need, social media has ingratiated itself into the meaning of human existence. It has become the backbone of a whole generation's social experience.

We will not give it up.

The fluidity and frictionless expansion of our social networks have given a practical truth to the once theoretical six degrees of separation. Not only can we reach virtually anyone through those six degrees of separation, but we can hear them, and they can hear us.

Of course, that's not practical at all. Too many voices is just as bad as none at all, worse even in it's thunderous confusion. But this problem is also solved by social media by the same means it has solved discoverability: it surface to you only those voices it thinks you'll find engaging.

Now let's take a step back and talk about ideas, the qualia of human speech and communication. Even before the internet, we did not stand around in silent circles. No, we speak to each other [^8], and that speech carries on it ideas.

Despite what many philosophers would like to believe, human kind is not actually very rational. We don't come to our ideas and beliefs primarily through rigorous investigation and rational thought. We come by our ideas through our social interactions [^10]. It is only post adoption of these beliefs that we bring to bear all our considerable logical armaments, all brought in to defend a position we've already decided was true.

Smart people aren't more likely to be right than anyone; they're just much better at defending their beliefs.

Ideas have been likened to viruses.

I'll give you a moment to snicker as you fondly recall some dumb idea you watched spread through social media like wild fire, only to sputter out a few weeks later, forgotten and discarded as the next new engagement proliferates. This phenomena isn't new. Ideas have taken fire all throughout human history, sometimes to disastrous results. Hell, the entirety of the enlightenment period could be defined as nothing but the spread of ideas, and that anecdote should serve to illustrate just how misleading the viral analogy really is; we don't experience the rapid spread of "good" viruses throughout the physical world or, at least, not that I'm aware of.

The problem, of course, is that we've hyper-connected humanity in such a way as to exaggerate the communicative facets of social interaction, while minimizing or outright denying the physical aspects. While these communicative aspects are an important part of social interaction, they're certainly not all that we need. They are, however, just about all that we're getting.

Can you picture a group of people, huddled around their phones, faces lit up by artificial light, thumbs flipping screens, oblivious to the world around them, consumed by the world before them?

It's a common picture [^11], one we're all familiar with. The time we spend on our phones has increased over the years to worrying levels as we feed ourselves an endless drip stream of small dopamine hits. And like any good drug, these interactions provide the illusion of the real thing, feeding us the sugary contents of social interaction we crave, while denying us the substance inherent in the real thing.

Flip the feed, type a comment, receive a few likes; post an update, receive a few comments; like a post, something cute or perhaps outrageous, and share it with your world. It _feels_ almost like interacting with others, and while on a technical level it is, it yet denies us the nutrition we need. 

Yet the craving increases, drawing our hands back to our phone, our eyes to the posts, the pics, the videos, all the while we waste away [^12]. The only true social interaction involved is our poor man's substitute for verbal communication, and much of that has to do with the passing of ideas; we eat up like like our last meal.

Is it any wonder ideas spread like viruses? The only way we can satisfy our need to be social is to agree with others. In "real" life, you can disagree with your friends and still be part of the social group. On the internet, this becomes much more difficult, making it imperative that we form our social groups around common ideas.

Furthermore, simple agreement is not enough; engagement is necessary. Otherwise, the group becomes stale and uninteresting. Silence in the presence of another can be bonding; silence on the internet is nothing but isolation. There is an implicit requirement that to be part of the group, one must be engaging in the discussion.

Be interesting or be ignored.

Then there are the algorithms themselves. They also are geared almost entirely toward engagement, the kind that keeps people coming back with glossy eyes skimming money-making ads while looking for the next dopamine hit.

This aligns nicely with the integrated incentives naturally baked into the platform. People need to be engaging to feel part of the social group; the algorithms promote those who are most interesting to others. If you can be engaging enough, you'll show up in other's feeds, suddenly liked and commented on and shared. The spotlight is on you, the center of the world... or at least, it is for a moment.

The greatest reinforcement of behavior is randomness in the rewards. It's the principle behind all gambling and the core of what keeps people posting. There's always a chance that your next post will land on jackpot, placing you back in the center and reinforcing that desperate need to belong.

"Can you believe?" 

"Did you hear?"

"Look at what they did!"

Outrage, shock, disbelief, and the unbelievable. It ranges from the incredible to the downright cruel. All is fair game if there's even the chance it will propel you back into the spotlight. The key is simple: push the edge, just a little. You don't want people to ~walk~ click away in disgust, but they need to be engaged.

Ever so slowly, we push ourselves to the fringes, spouting beliefs we'd never have considered before,sharing conspiracy theories, fake news, unresearched opinions, whatever it takes for the likes. 

And it's all so easy. A like is a tap and a share but a little more. There is no friction but the tragedy of the commons.




[^1]: I'm sure they were robed. In my head, the elite are always robed with ornate lapels and slippers on their feet. While this may be only an assumption on my part, I'm certain it's perfectly reasonable.
[^2]: Of course, we pay not for the information, but for the certificate that says we actually read that information and understand it, maybe. At least, we sat in the same room the information was disgorged.
[^3]: I'm looking at you Medium, but is Tumbler even around anymore? Or has Yahoo eaten it's own billion-dollar tail?
[^4]: Yes, with capitalization. Given the impact, I feel it deserves at least that. Might even do all caps except I'm fatally allergic to all cap... that and my caps lock is broken.
[^5]: Okay, there's a lot of reasons they succeeded, and I'm not so dense to think success came down to a single factor, but it is an important factor and the one I'm choosing to focus on now.
[^6]: Or not. People still love cat videos.
[^7]: Yeah, I got tired of capitalizing it.
[^8]: I swear Facebook _does_ show me random people, but I have this suspicion it's only because I've confused their algorithm so thoroughly that it really has no other choice. LinkedIn, at least, has a pretty decent focus on my professional history, although I'm still not sure why they show me random potential friends from— oh... huh yeah, never mind. I get it.
[^9]: Yes, I know, and we don't _just_ speak either, but some of the other "things" done between humans are beyond the scope of this post, and thus will be summarily ignored.
[^10]: I'm making some very broad characterizations that are not easily defended. Clearly all people _do_ in fact have ideas that are come to by investigation and rational thought. I do not, however, believe that most of our ideas are come to in this manner. Put bluntly, rational thought is not actually anywhere on the list of "basic human needs", where as our social inclinations very much are.
[^11]: I'll admit that in my mind this picture is usually of a subway train car, which is completely unfair. Rewind the picture a few decades and they're holding newspapers instead of phones. While humanity needs social interaction, the public subway is not the normal place for it, though it seems to be a favorite place to photograph the decline of civilization.
[^12]: Yeah, yeah, I'm being dramatic. I do that sometimes. But I think the point still carries well.

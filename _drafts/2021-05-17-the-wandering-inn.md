<!--start-->

This is not a book; it's a web series. It's an important distinction, because if you approach this like you might a book or even a standard book series, you just may find yourself sucked into a world far larger than you anticipated.

It's problematic because you may not want to leave, and there's a whole-freaking lot to keep you there, and you very likely have an actual life to live. Good luck with that.

I came across the series from the recommendation of several different authors I follow: Will Wight, I think, and Andrew Rowe? I don't fully recall, but it was enough for me to Google the term, find the website, and immediately discover I could start reading the series on the web, now, for free, no strings attached. 

Bleh. Who actually wants to read a book on a website? Seriously. I bought a kindle for a reason [^1] that's not purely due to eye strain. 

It turns out there _are_ kindle books, three of them, that almost encompass three of the... eight volumes? Huh. And these are not small books; I believe one of them clocks in at around eleven hundred pages.

Still, I read the ebooks, and discovered I really wanted more. I just had to sacrifice my soul on the alter of inconvenient web text and [groan] manual syncing.

<!--more-->

I like this series a lot, so let's first get out of the way things I _don't_ like. There's not a whole lot to the list, but there is some, and they mostly revolves around the prose itself. I should point out the prose itself improves greatly as the series progresses, though most of my complaints never change. Also, I read an interview with 'pirateaba' where they [^2] explain how much they dislike editing, which is mostly limited to spell check. More on that later.

Word craft this is not. Pirateaba isn't interested much in grammar, especially punctuation, and they're certainly not creating beautifully crafted paragraphs. I rather suspect that to them, prose is a tool to tell a story and nothing more. They're good at that, very good, and for me it smoothes over most issues. While I do like reading well crafted prose, at the end of the day the reason I'm reading is for the story.

The Wandering Inn is a very good story. It's just that...

### Dialog

I _hate_ the way they write dialog. This is probably my biggest issue, and one that never fades away. Pirateaba seems to subscribe to the belief that all dialog should always be on its own line. There is never other text. Never. Beats are placed on the prior or following paragraphs and often are... buried? That's not the right word. The beat is always adjacent to the dialog, but it's hard to identify as a beat when it's part of an overall paragraph. It's sometimes before and sometimes after the dialog, and sometimes there's no beat at all.

There's a school of thought that posits dialog should stand up on its own. If it doesn't, then the dialog needs to be rewritten. Some authors will strip out their "he saids, she saids" and even remove all the beats [^3] with this idea in mind. This sort of thing isn't a bad idea, _if_ you're practicing your writing; it's a fantastic way to tell if the dialog is flat and relies too much on beats for character. Thing is, beats and tags are important to the reader, cause guess what?

_It doesn't matter if you don't know who's talking!_

It doesn't take long for me to look back (or ahead) and figure out from context who's speaking; I've never actually not figured it out. It does, however, rip me out of the story each and every time. If this happened only once or twice? Okay, I can deal; nobody's perfect. But there comes a point when I realize I'm doing this for the third time in a single chapter, and that's just downright frustrating.

### Foreshadowing

So, there's foreshadowing and then there's **FORESHADOWING**. What's the difference? With foreshadowing, an event or scene is written in such a way as to to imply or suggest something to come. It could be obtuse, such as a character experiencing some ominous feeling; it could be subtle, such that the way the scene is described suggests something to come.  

Or, it could be **FORESHADOWING**, which often comes across like a bag of bricks:

> "And little did Erin know that this day was to be the worst day of her life..."

^ [^4]

It reeks of distrust (to me, at least), as though the author could not figure out or be bothered enough to actually write in a cliff hanger. They're afraid the reader won't turn the page, so they throw in some line to keep the reader hooked.

_Oh no! What ever will happen to my favorite character!_

Does any reader actually think that when bludgeoned with such obvious **FORE...** (okay, enough of the caps) _foreshadowing_ (better?). Or do they roll their eyes and try to decide if the story is good enough to warrant a page turn in light of such bad writing?

I have yet to see any such line add anything to a story in any book I've ever read. In most cases, it detracts, suggesting the author is insecure and uncertain of their plot. I begin to wonder if they're loosing confidence. I begin to wonder if the story is going to falter. Why else would you need to add something like that? 

To be clear, The Wandering Inn never falters. The story's been more than enough to keep me turning the page [^5] even after five volumes, which is what, like ten books at least?

I personally don't like foreshadowing unless it's incredibly subtle, but so much of my objection to it could be attributed to quicks in my personality. When I'm reading, I want to read about what's happening now. I want to be drawn in to it. What I don't want, is for the author to rip me out and jab their finger into the future with impatient words about how great it's going to be.

Stop trying to draw me into the future. I'll get there in my own time.

### Periods

This is a minor issue that could be easily be written off as stylistic choice. It doesn't affect reading or the story or even detract much. It's a missed opportunity is all.

Pirateaba has a tendency to break up perfectly good sentences into incomplete fragments using a period. It's... fine. Fiction writers often feel free to break the rules of grammar; I have no problem with that. Personally, I think breaking the rules can be used to great effect. However, when it's done too much, one of two things happen:

 1. The prose becomes garbled and difficult to read.
 2. The violations fade away into the background and the effect is lost.

Centuries of reading and writing have conditioned us to expect certain patterns in prose. Sentence structure, punctuation, and even word order are like a conductor's baton, taking disparate noises and elevating it to harmonic symphony. _Breaking_ those rules is a sour note. It draws attention, like a poem that rhymes until the very last word [^6]. The dissonance drives home that word like a hammer.

Breaking the rule of grammars is like that. 

Pirateaba does it too much, but at no point does the prose become difficult to read. It just fades away. Given how our author uses the periods, I suspect they do it for pacing. The words are cadence in their mind, and the periods are an attempt to replicate that. 

But here's the thing: the English language has plenty of other punctuations marks that can do this. Take the humble comma, for instance. Yes, it is probably one of the most overused punctuations marks in any language, but perhaps that's only because it's really good at what it does. But if you don't like the comma, it's not like there aren't other punctuation marks. We have a semicolon; we have a colon; we have an ellipses— we even have a dash or [gasp] a _long_ dash. And, of course, there's all sorts of brackets that can be employed.

There's so many ways to structure language, so many tools available, and the author eschews all but one: a period. 

As I said, it doesn't exactly detract, but it's a missed opportunity. It makes me sad, cause sometimes I stop and read a paragraph and realize while it's decent, it's just a few punctuation marks away from being great.

### Save the edits, please

You can roughly divide all authors into two main camps [^7]: those who edit, and those who don't. There are pros and cons to each category: It's easy for the "editors" to become bogged down in the pursuit of perfection and take years between their releases. On the other hand, those who don't edit can often embed their mistakes with each new word they write.

Pirataba is not an editor; they've said this. Not only are they not inclined, but their very schedule doesn't allow for it— two chapters a week are _a lot_ to write. 

This is not a complaint, but I feel it should be mentioned: The Wandering Inn is unapologetically what it is, errors and all. While there are three books on the Kindle Store that _have_ gone through an editing process, it's telling how far behind they are to what's on the website. It's also telling that most grammar and structural issues remain in those books.

If you want to enjoy it (and I highly recommend you do), you best get used to the issues. Ignore them, complain, roll your eyes, or whatever, but then move on and keep reading. Cause at the end of the day, what really matters is the story, and pirateaba has a great one to tell.

## The Story

A great one? That's wrong; it's more like a plethora of great stories. Yes, there's a main one and spoilers, it's Erin, the one you start with. But to pay attention to just the "primary" story is wrong, simply because just about _every_ story told in The Wandering Inn universe is equally good.

### Our Kind of Story

First, let's talk about what _kind_ of story is being told:

 - Massive world building: check.
 - Epic with lot's of story lines: check.
 - Fleshed out characters that feel real and undergo authentic transformations: double-check... maybe even triple check.
 - Deep and consistent magic system: well... it's broad. Not sure how consistent it is (literally, I'm unsure and I'm disinclined to research it), and there are hints of depth or deeper truths kinda thing, but so far it's mostly just broad. Think: a lot of different spells broken up into tiers.
 - LitRPG: sort of? There are levels and they're really important to the world/people/plot. But the levelling system itself is simplistic (also a bit random) and there is a distinct lack of the character sheets common to the genre. Personally, I consider this a plus; I do not like skimming character sheets. Either way, let's call it very, very lite LitRPG.
 - The classic Herione's Journey: check.

> Oh, I know this one! That's like the Hero's Journey, but with a bad ass beautiful female kicking everyone's ass in skin-tight leather! [^8]

Ah... no.

First off, some clarification: The Hero's/Heroine's Journey has nothing to do with gender. 

Ack! Even that's not right. The _name_ certainly does lean into gender stereotypes. Men are prone to go at it alone, women are supposed to be cooperative, ladedadeda, whatever. It's disturbing. Our stereotypes are so deeply ingrained into our culture such that the best way to title our story types is to use them. I can't help but feel like something went wrong there.

The definition has nothing to do with gender. A Hero's Journey could easily be taken by any gender, just as a Heroine's Journey could. In truth, even the structure of the story could remain largely the same between them— hell, even the basic stages of a Hero's Journey can apply [^9]. What's different, though, is _how_ they take that journey, how they overcome their obstacles, and what the resulting tension and victory looks like. The result is a very different book, even if the plot lines are largely the same.

Take what I like to call the 'isolation' stage. In this stage, our intrepid hero is stripped of their companions. In the Hero's journey, this would result in the hero turning inward, finding (or developing) their inner strength, coming to some kind of deep realization or self-actualization, and emerging stronger for it. Isolation ends when our hero finds the strength to overcome the external circumstances causing it or changes enough internally to leave it.

The Heroine's Journey inverts this. Instead of becoming stronger, isolation makes our protagonist weaker (or at the very least stays the same). As they progress through this stage, they are met with failure after failure until they are forced to realize that they can't do it alone; they need others to succeed. A good writer will force the protagonist to deal with their inner demons in order to accept this truth. Isolation ends when the protagonist overcomes the inner demons keeping them from accepting help.

The stage is the same but the form of it could not be different. Whereas the Hero's Journey focuses on personal achievement, the Heroine's Journey focuses on personal relationships. This shift in focus changes not only the meaning of the struggles, but of the underlying tension and drama within the story. Within the Hero's Journey, personal loss is often used an impetus for growth, whereas in the Heroine's Journey, loss is just... loss. There's no justifying it with personal growth. It hurts. That's the point.

There are entire books that detail the Heroine's Journey, so I'll refrain from any further commentary on it [^10]. 

The Wandering Inn is a large epic plot of heroine stories. Yes, there are heroes; yes, there are battles, magic, fights, and intrigue. But the bulk of the drama lies in the relationships and how they evolve. Pirateaba is a master at fleshing out characters, drawing you in, and then setting up plot lines that pit them against each other in a way that sets up war as a tragedy instead of some glorious self-masturbatory monument to violence and the unending quest for power.

Too often fantasy books spend a lot of time detailing the evils of the antagonist simply so the hero can engage in gratuitous violence. War is a plot line instead of being the tragedy it should be. 

[^1]: Which I don't use nearly as much as I'd thought because I always have my phone in hand whereas I must actually remove my ass from my seat to go get my kindle. But hey, still, kindle apps sync, and the website does not. I really wish it would, though.  I've had some thought to manually copy each chapter from each volume of the series into a doc I can convert into an ebook using Calibri or something. It just that it _sounds_ like a lot of work. Still...
[^2]: He? She? I don't know, and it doesn't really matter in any meaningful sense. However, I've gotten the impression it's something of a mystery, maybe? I didn't spend any time trying to figure it out, but I would be surprised if the writer were male. There are scenes and even whole chapters that deal with subjects that would not occur to most of the male species on our planet, with the possible exception of some of the more conscientious married men.
[^3]: FYI - A 'beat' is a short scene set alongside the dialog. It almost always (and probably should always) feature the person speaking. As such, it's a way to avoid the "he/she said" tags by replacing them with (usually) more visual action.  For instance: John narrowed his eyes. "I don't think so." 
[^4]: I made this up; it's not a line from the book. It _could_ be, though. Really. Some of the foreshadowing is almost that bad.
[^5]: Or click into the next chapter? [Sigh] I really hate not having this on the kindle.
[^6]: Oh god, I'm mixing metaphors. I'm so sorry. Someone, please help! Stop me!
[^7]: No, no you can't. That's just stupid, as though any group of people can so easily slot into our nicely pre-packaged categories. At best, there's spectrum, but most likely, the truth reflects categories we've never even thought of. Of course, while this is all true, it conflicts with my desire to make a point, and so thus will I ignore the pesky mess of reality and pretend everything is neatly packaged.
[^8]: Okay, okay. Let's not be sexist. They could _also_ be wearing a metal bikini.
[^9]: Which isn't really surprising given just how broad and flexible the Hero's Journey is defined. 
[^10]: Lol. No, no I won't.

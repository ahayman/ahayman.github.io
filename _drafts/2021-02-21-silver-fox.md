<!--start-->

It is not often that I feel the need to start a review describing everything wrong with a book. There's a few reasons for this. For one, even though I go to great lengths to pick apart a book I'm reviewing, this doesn't mean I don't like the book. So I try to start with what I like before picking it apart. Also, I tend not to finish books I don't like and I don't review books I haven't finished [^1].

I did finish this and the other four books in the series. Yet these books contain some of the worst writing I have ever encountered. It's not even about styleâ€” authors often break the rules for effect or readability. This book was barely readable for so many reasons.

- The run on sentences are so prevalent that several times I stopped to look back and check that, yes, the author did in fact understand that you use a period to end sentences and not just paragraphs. Even then, I'm not entirely certain he wasn't just accidentally hitting the period instead of the comma.
- The prose isn't just purple, but repetitively so. Just about everything is a grand statement, all made worse by overuse of a limited set of adjectives. There was a point I stopped seeing the word "lush", so thin had it been worn by overuse. I would very much like to introduce the author to a thesaurus, yet fear he would simply fill the book with even more adjectives.
- Even the dialog is purple. Everyone speaks in grand statements composed of flower language that often conveys very little actual content. This has the effect of making everyone sound the same.
- There is little depth in any of the side characters. They all seem to exist only to show (or tell, with flowery language) just how awesome the main character is. Entire side plots revolved around people first underestimating the main character, only to realize just how awesome he really is. Everyone is astonished, over and over again, until I found myself quickly skimming pages to move on.
- The main character is not likable. He spends an inordinate amount of time being astonished with himself and how far he has come. Entire pages are devoted to the main character realizing over and over again how awesome he is. 
- There was way too much wish masochistic fulfilment going on. The author objectifies just about every woman the protagonist meets, all of whom practically fall over themselves to get him into bed. 
- Even when he "struggles" with the sheer amount of blood-thirsty violence he's overly prone to commit, it's phrased less for the struggle itself than to demonstrate just how much he's forced to sacrifice. In other words, even his struggles are a form of humble bragging.
- The author has not simply eschewed showing for telling, but sailed right on past that into painful repetitive detail describing what we as the reader should feel about everything going on.

Why, then, did I read not one, but five of these books?

## Quantity over Quality

Well first, I want to add some perspective. These are big books; I believe the last one rang in at around 650 pages. He also wrote it in about three months, judging from his prior release. It's an incredible pace. I doubt the book goes through any real drafts, perhaps only a spell check (but no grammar) and maybe a read over before release. Clearly, the author is going for quantity (and perhaps predictability) over quality.

And this is a perfectly valid approach. Hell, it's one I've considered; I've written enough for at least five books in all my rewrites. All of that is stuff I could have self published, and perhaps even made some money. Or it would just ruin a newly budding reputation, yet I still consider it. My biggest reason for not adopting this approach was that all these rewrites was a learning process for me. I wrote knowing I didn't need to release and would probably be rewriting it all over again. That gave me a lot of freedom to screw up. But it's even more impressive (to me, at least) when an author is willing to do this publicly.

I will never begrudge an author that does it.

I'm also willing to overlook a lot of faults, especially if the book is entertaining enough. I _like_ knowing that in three months, I'll get to rejoin the story. Yes, there are bad parts, but I can skim; that's okay. 

And, in contrast, the (multi?) year long wait between releases from some of my favorite authors can make me very critical. Two years between release? Yeah, it better be divine poetry.

And so yeah. I skimmed over large parts of the book, dipping in for the stuff I really liked while trying to ignore the rest.

## World Building 

The biggest draw for me in this series is the world building. However quickly he blows through the writing process, he clearly enjoys creating unique worlds filled with interesting locations, immortals, gods, assassins, etc. Everything is oversized, larger than life, and filled with magic and mystery.

I like this kind of stuff. There always seems to be something new, something to explore. This kind of constant revealing of the world gives it the feeling of excitement and depth. That's a big draw for a lot of people.

Add to this a deep and flexible magic system that pervades everything that constantly feels new.

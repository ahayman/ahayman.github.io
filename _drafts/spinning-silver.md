![Spinning Silver Book Cover]()

<!--start-->

Okay, so having read "A Deadly Education", I decided to finally go back and read "Spinning Silver", that book I kept seeing recommended but never read because I just _knew_ it was a stupid retelling of a story I already knew.

And I hate stupid retelling of stories I already know. I really do.

Except this was not that... and yet, somehow, it was almost just as annoying.

So here's the thing: this was a great story. Really. I loved the _story_. It kept me reading as a story should.

But, oh my god did it do it in such a painfully laborious way.

\<sigh\> Okay. Let's just get this out of the way cause it's clearly on my mind. Naomi loves, and by 'loves' I mean she absolutely adores with unadulterated passion, endless segues into her character's minds as they opine over their past in exquisite detail.

Instead of "Rachael [not her name] looked at the farm with longing," we are instead treated to a six page recitation of just _why_ she looked on the farm with longing.

...and, I kinda of get it. 

I currently have... well, not pages, but perhaps many paragraphs of exactly the same thing, where I recite to the reader the character's past so that _they can understand them_. I mean, I've spent who-knows-how-long coming up with their past and how can the reader expect to understand them if I don't expound on how and what exactly brought them here...

Except, in the end, "she looked on the farm with longing," is exactly all that we, as the writer, need to use convey the longing the character is experiencing.  In fact, why not leave it to the reader's imagination? Having learned about so-and-so for half the book, our readers can very easily understand why she would want a farm of her own. In fact, I would argue the reader's imagination just... _just_ might be better than our own.More to the point, all this explaining distracts from the actual story, forcing the reader to either skim or postpone the plot.

And I do not mean to imply that all such exposition is inexcusable. There are certainly times when a character's past must be understood in order to grasp the current situation. But that situation is, I believe, quite a bit scarcer than most authors might believe. 

Let's move on.

The story itself is outstanding. In all the copy and reviews I read, Spinning Silver was supposed to be some kind of retelling of Rumplestiltskin. And while there are similarities, these appear less as similitude and more as threads randomly picked out for inspiration. Spinning Silver was, in other words, a story that may have been _inspired_ by Rumplestiltskin, but only so broadly. I would argue this book was it's own writing, and trying to describe it as a derivative of some fairy tale actually diminishes the true value of what the author has done here.

I can't quite say the same thing about her choice to use multiple first person perspectives. The problem with the first person is the narrator very rarely refers to themself. This isn't a problem when there's only one point of view, but multiple view points force the reader to divine the person speaking through contextâ€” you can't just say "Joe woke up"; it's always "I woke up" but who is I? 

Dialog, location, and circumstances are natural places for the reader to look, but it can take time to figure those out. In meantime, the reader has potentially consumed paragraphs without actually knowing who's speaking. In the case of Spinning Silver, more than once I read an entire section believing it was of one person, only to come across something later that made me realize I'd actually read a completely different character. They'd been travelling together, so almost all the clues were the same.

The best way to deal with this is to create a unique tone for each character by imbuing the character's personality and emotional state into the narrative writing style. Done right, the reader will know who's speaking almost immediately, sometimes without any context at all, merely by virtue of the words used. Each character perspective should _feel_ like it was written by a different author.

For instance, I'm writing a character who's very particular, somewhat neurotic about their clothes, and has an impeccable, almost unnatural sense of time and space. Nothing ever takes only a few seconds; nothing is ever close or far. That character would never admit to such vague terms. Instead, it took four seconds, and the door was eight paces away (and there were twelve boards between him and the door). No other character does this, so the moment we see "four seconds" instead of a "few seconds", we know of whom we're reading.

And that leads right into the 'show don't tell' mantra so often repeated to newly budding writers. But how do you give to the reader a sense of who their character is? As writers, we often (and should) have a clear image in our head of our character; we know them intimately. We want the reader to know our character as well as we do, and so the temptation to tell them who our character is, what they're thinking, what they're feeling, their past and, at times, directly why that character does what they does. While this tells the reader who their character is, it reads more like something you might read in the news; it's distant, like gossip, and the reader doesn't really know the character intimately as much as they know _about_ the character.

This difference between knowing about a character and knowing a character intimately, is the difference between having your characters come alive on the page and reading a vaguely interesting story about other people.

This is where I felt disappointed by Spinning Silver, for while I thought the story was great, I never truly connected to any of the characters. I knew so many things about each of them, but never really connected to them. Furthermore, I eventually began to confuse them, mistaking one for the other until it almost didn't matter who was who.

None of this is to say it was not a good story. It was. Naomi has a fantastic sense plot and the way she weaves together multiple perspectives has the opportunity of being truly genius.

For a while now I've been slowly chewing my way through a book called "Philosophy in the Flesh", by George Lakoff. As with most books even tangentially related to philosophy, it can probably only ever be taken slow in small chunks. I will probably finish it before I die, probably.

This is not a book review, so I'm not going to review it. Mostly I want to chew through Lakoff's thoughts and idea, turn them over, think through and internalize their ramifications.

The book espouses a philosophy that revolves around a central idea of "embodied thinking". Many philosophies exist in pure reason or else spiritual awareness, or some mix of the two. 

Lakoff uses the cognitive sciences as the foundation for a new (?) kind of philosophy who's central tenant is that all our thoughts, all of our reasoning, our logic, and the very mechanisms by which we think are embodied by our physical being. Everything that we are arises from who we are physically. There's no consideration of a soul, a spirit, an afterlife. There is no such thing as disembodied logic. Such thing is only an illusion. 

It is by studying the inner mechanisms of our physical brain that we understand ourselves.

title: Why I write
categories: [thoughts]
---

It's occurred to me — not unprompted — that I've not explained why I write, and this oversight may cause some slight, or perhaps even significant misunderstandings about my writing. I'm not saying this has happened [^1], but for the sake of clarity, something I'm actually quite horrible at, let's clarify what exactly I'm doing when I write something.

I write to explore and discover.

This cannot be overstated. I am not writing to convince you of any one thing; I am not writing simply to express myself [^2]; I am not writing to propound a single perspective. And _that_ seems to be an oddly hard pill for some people to swallow. 

I take this for granted, for it is the way I am. I play with ideas like a toddler plays with toys. I focus wholly on the idea before me, often expounding into absurdity the inherent arguments, and then drop and forget it as though it had never existed. I turn arguments on their head, flip them about in the light, look for the shadows, feel the edges, and generally fondle them until I've fingered every nook and cranny. 

I do not expound these things because I believe them. I do not believe them because I believe nothing.

Bleh. What a stupid statement. Of course sanity requires irrational belief, but of course I would say that: I believe all belief is irrational [^3], and that you must have belief to function in this world.

Yet I've had my certainty in belief destroyed long ago, and this not as a simple change of opinion, but one of those life events that irrevocably changes who you are as a person [^4]. I'm incapable of holding as true any one truth; and while I believe there is truth, I doubt we could ever know it, or if we do, I doubt we know which of our truths are true in truth. 

Please don't murder me.

But sometimes there are people who want to read my writing as arguments I'm making as though I believe they are true [^5]. This is absurd for reasons I've expounded. 

But I love exploring these things, and I will not stop.

So you, dear reader, assuming you find the courage to consume my rants, will read things I do not believe, purely for the sake of exploring the idea. I'm endlessly curious about these things, and so I pro





[^1]: It has.
[^2]: Eh... okay, I do write for expression and it's a satisfying thing to do. But never confuse the satisfaction of exploring an idea, which is itself its own form of expression, for the purpose of writing to express oneself. 
[^3]: Please tell me you see the irony of this statement.
[^4]: I'll recount this event some day, I so swear on the certainty I most certainly do not have... ... and oh god, that was fun to write.
[^5]: Read: family.

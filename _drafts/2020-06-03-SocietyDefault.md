I am society's default. I am normal. 

A white male, born in 80's, raised to a middle-class family. Though my family suffered divorce, I never had to worry about where I'd live, nor whether the electricity would be turned off, or the water, or the phone, or the TV. Our house wasn't large, but neither was it small; both my brother and I had our own rooms. We had a computer, and room to play, and toys to play with, and trees to climb, and trouble to get in. We never missed a Christmas, or Thanksgiving, or even Memorial day. 

I went to a private middle school, mostly white, and a public high school that was also white, black, and hispanic, a fairly typical makeup for central Florida. Most kids stuck to their groups and clicks, which I identified more by interest than by race. I made friends, as kids do, with those that aligned with my interests.  Some of them were minorities, but I never paid attention to that. They were just people to me, and they were my friends, and had fewer of those than I wanted. The fights I did see break out were just fights between kids, and the struggles I saw and the struggles I went through were all the same struggles kids go through at that age.

Throughout my life I have made friends without respect to race. I never sought them out, or avoided them. My room mate for many years was African, and we are good friends. I dated a Haitian in my twenties and enjoyed both her presence and her culture. But most people I've dated and befriended are like me, including the woman I married.

I went to college and paid for it myself; but it didn't work out. Life got in the way, or I had other ideas, or something happened and after three tries I quit, even though I was only a year from graduating. I taught myself software development and have made at least as much money doing that as I would have with a degree. In the end, college didn't really matter to me.

It wasn't easy. I spent years struggling to learn enough to market myself; I spent years studying harder to teach myself software development than I ever did in school. My wife supported me in those times in a way I can never truly repay. And she went through her own struggles, earning a medical degree and enduring residency and two fellowships all while delivering two baby boys and one girl. What she has accomplished is nothing short of incredible to me.

We live in our dream home, on four acres with a small orchard, a struggling garden, and mountains in the distance. I have three kids, and they play often in wide open spaces when they're not on their iPads and iPhones and Nintendo Switches. It is everything I ever wanted or hoped I could attain in a home.

When we moved here, we asked where the bad parts of town were. The person we asked laughed and said maybe the college center because... well, college students, but otherwise, no, there's no bad place to live.  We were delighted.

My family and I took a walk the other day and saw our neighbor.  We talked, making sure to maintain an appropriate six feet distance, and she told us about an attempted robbery. It was the first time something like this has happened in years. Usually, when we hear local news, it's about something stupid the local college students had done. Robbery was new, and it had set the whole town was abuzz.

We love our town. We love our life.

On the periphery, I hear rumbles of civil unrest in distant cities.

We talk about Trump, about how horrible he is, and how we can't wait until a literate president replaces him. We talk about how much better things were under Obama, and how unfortunate it is that so many people support such blatant fascism. We talk about the coronavirus and how horrible it is that so many people lost their jobs. We talk about how we can't wait for things to go back to normal, and we talk about what that normal might look like. We laugh that the quarantine barely changed my life, where I already was working from home, only to leave for the occasional shopping trip.

I don't remember when George Floyd died. It took days or weeks before I knew who he was or how he died or why it mattered. It only entered my consciousness because he kept showing up in my news feeds along with the protests and, of course, the rioting.  But all that is happening in a different place, a distant place.

I think the riots are unfortunate, and I applaud Obama for encouraging a peaceful solution where Trump threatens with only violence.

In college I took classes on social awareness and responsibility. We were taught about cultures; we read stories of the difficulties facing minorities; we learned what the appropriate responses were and how we might help, but I cannot recall what they were. What I remember is a story we read of a minority who struggled to learn and excel in academia even while his friends and culture derided him for it. I don't remember his name, but I do remember the lesson. I remember one lesson, and it was about how cultures can tear down those who live in them for the sake of conformity. 

We are all products of our cultures, and I like mine.

I walk into a store anonymous, where people don't notice me or my skin or my hair or my eyes. There is no scrutiny to what I do there. People don't wonder whether I will steal anything; they don't spare a second glance at the bags I carry out. I could, if I wanted, shoplift an entire grocery cart worth of food and nobody would ever notice. Of course, it doesn't matter. I have never needed to shoplift anything in my life.

I frequently speed, but haven't gotten a ticket in over a decade.  I'm careful to make sure I never speed too much, but I don't hesitate to pass a cop while going ten over. Even when I was pulled over, I've always knew why. Once, in my twenties, I was pulled over for speeding. I had a gun in the car, so I handed the officer my permit and explained where the gun was. He had me take it out, and then showed me his, and we talked about guns for a while. He let me off with a warning and advice on how much I could speed before being pulled over.

Do you understand yet? I am society's default, and the world has bent itself to me.

I have no idea which kids struggled in my high school; I have no idea which kids were abused; I have no idea which kids lived in fear of homelessness; I have no idea if any kids struggled against prejudice or bias and if they did, I have no idea what that prejudice looked like.

I didn't know because I never needed to know. I cannot see because I don't need to see. I am society's default, and all of society was built for me.  I believe my world is normal, that I am not privileged but industrious, that my struggles are the same as everyone else, that all the world is as fair as mine. 

I seek to treat all those around me equal, no matter their race, but I do not know what prejudice is like; I cannot understand it.  I can only imagine prejudice, but the image is distant and blurry, filled with concrete streets and angry faces, with shouts and guns, fire and gas. It bears no resemblance to my life.

I have believed that black lives matter, and that the exact extent of the subject for me.

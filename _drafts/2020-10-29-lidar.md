As most addicted technophiliacs have done, I got my new iPhone 12 Pro on day one. In my defense, both my wife and I are on the Apple iPhone upgrade program, and have long since integrated the monthly cost of our addiction into our budget, then promptly forgotten about it until the next upgrade cycle. And so we've long since been in the habit of upgrading our phones every year.

It's a sign of the times, where my car languishes in age and I couldn't care less so long as I have CarPlay and the newest phone. At least it's cheaper than becoming a car enthusiast-- or well, that's my excuse, anyway.

This year I discussed amongst myself the age old question: but do I _really_ need a new phone? The answer, as usual, was a resounding no. The old one was just fine-- better than fine, really; it's a great phone.

But the camera is better this year! ... as it is every year. And in the past these camera upgrades have driven me to buy the largest of the phones, only to be irritated by the surfboard in my pocket. So I resisted, and this year settled for sub-par cameras instead of the magical photo-taking prowess of the larger specimen... which would in truth have no discernible effect I could ever make out.

So yeah, the new phone's nice; it's pretty; it's fast; it's got great cameras. Yet overall, it performs almost exactly like my old one.

Almost.

Lidar, folks, is where your phone shoots out a bunch of lasers and then uses the speed of light to measure the time it takes for the reflection to come back, allowing it to calculate the distance to the object that reflected the light.

Wait, back up. This bears repeating: our phones shoot out _lasers_ now.

No, they don't burn holes in anything. You can't even see them, but who cares? Our phones shoot lasers. My past, adolescent self is crying tears of joy right now. 

Moving on, despite the obvious 'coolness' shooting lasers, the practicality of them is a full size 'meh'. The key feature: it focuses faster in the dark.

Hmmm... okay, that's nice.

Oh, and AR [^1], in case I want to pretend my phone is a tricorder and scan the environment for threats or something, but my old phone had that too.

And so I wrote it off as... hmmm, not a gimmick, but perhaps just a little early. I think I'll be truly excited when I can hold my phone up, have it scan my environment, and produce a nice minimap showing where I'm walking.

Then I took this photo:

This kind of shot would have been difficult in the past. The biggest problem is the camera's huge depth of field, which keeps too much of the scene in focus. It's nice for taking photos that are rarely out of focus, but when you _want_ that effect you've been traditionally out of luck.

Apple has had a "Portrait" mode on their phones for a few years now. Designed to mimic bokeh on a person, it's had somewhat... wonky results. More miss than hit, but on occasion it's been able to produce decent results. The problem is that it's used AI to figure out the "subject" so it could blur the background. That's pretty much been limited to people or, in recent years, maybe your pet.

Lidar, though changes things. Now the phone knows the distance to things. It still tries to find the subject, but if that fails, it can use the actual depth of the scene instead. It is this which allowed me to get the shot above.

It's a small thing, I know, but it makes me happy. These are my favorite kinds of shots. I frequently use them as wallpaper for my computer, phone, everything, changing them up with the season, etc. The new iPhone 12 Pro has expanded the kinds of photos I can take and that, at least for me, made it worth it.

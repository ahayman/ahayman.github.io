*...but is it? Is it, really?*

I've come across this statement more times than I can count, and every time I hear it I cringe. On one hand, I can understand why people say it; math has been probably the most instrumental tool in the development of our society as it now stands. Everything from sociology to rocket science to quantum physics all use math as the foundational aspect of their science. And without math, most of those fields of study couldn't exist at all. Hell, without math, our very society couldn't exist; just about everything we do depends on it.

And yet, the statement smacks of utter arrogance or, perhaps, profound ignorance. 

Yes, math has been an incredibly useful tool to understand the world around us, but at the end of the day it is only that: a tool. It's a perspective, a _way_ of viewing the world — the best way we have — but it only a perspective. There is nothing to suggest that math is a fundamental truth of reality itself.

But there _is_ evidence to suggest that math cannot completely describe all of reality. One pernicious missing truth, in particular, thwarts math's description of reality: one.

There is no one.

Or, at least, not that we can find. 

The objections are obvious: "But I'm _one_ person, and I'm looking at _one_ computer... one is _everywhere_."

Yes, that's all true at first glance, but one person constitutes billions of cells, and those cells have billions of atoms. The one that is you is legion of another thing. 

This search for one has been going on for a long time, really since the dawn of man. The Greeks spent a lot of time searching for and deliberating on the quintessence. Plato played with the idea of forms, the perfected ideals that in some way all things were derived from. 

For a little while, we used to think that atoms were "one". But with science we pierced that veil and now know that atoms have parts, and those parts have parts. Go deep enough, and suddenly you're in a realm where there is not one, but probability; things are described as _both_ a particle and wave, and it's location by probability distributions, and maybe it exists or perhaps we're all a hologram.

One, it turns out, is an illusion of distance.

Any "one" thing will disappear if you get close enough. The person is made of organs, which are made of cells, which are made of atoms. If there _is_ a quintessence, we haven't found it yet.

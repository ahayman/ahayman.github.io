I started sketching on my iPad to relax. I don't post every sketch I make; I do a lot of practice sketches that are generally not fit for human consumption. Some sketches come out well enough to post, so I do. They're not perfect, and I'm a complete self-taught amateur, but it can be fun to see me improve over time.

Here's the album if you don't care to read through the posts: [Sketch Album](https://photos.aaronhayman.com/r/16113393858894)

Fair warning: my "reviews" will not tell you if you will like the book. They're not intended to. Instead, they're a way for me to pick apart something I read.

They're a way for me to learn and grow as a writer. By doing a review or critique, I force myself to think through the book and bring to fore all that did and did not work for me. You'll find me often comparing it to my own writing, drawing parallels and discovering new approaches or faults. By seeing what another author does wrong, I often discover what I'm doing wrong in my own writing.

These are also very much my own opinion. It's quite likely I will poo-poo something you like. You will disagree and that's okay. Opinions aren't like truth such that there can be only one. You're allowed to have yours and I'm allowed mine. But having established that level of respect, feel free to post comments, discuss, and disagree. I encourage it. Discussion is yet another great way to learn.
